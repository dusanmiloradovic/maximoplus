Hi Jeff,

The idea is that the end user pay the annual server license - per server or per the named user. Vendors will have the free development license, and can also act as re-sellers. Other source of revenue will be training and professional services.
In your opinion what annual fee per server or per named user would be attractive to potential clients?

We don't have the ready made apps for sale. I am focused entirely on making the platform better and easier to use. If you have any question or suggestion please let me know.

If it's possible, can we continue over the email? You can reply me on dusan.miloradovic@gmail.com
